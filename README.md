Music, Film, and Upcoming Artists.

This site plays with the concept of panels which act like iOS modal screens in a way. The browser will autofocus to the panel by sliding the y coordinate it is on and open two screens, a left panel for playing music and the right with a description of what album and artist the song is from.
