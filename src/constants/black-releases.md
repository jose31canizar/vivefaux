Kuro

Faux’s junior album “Kuro” is the producer’s classic album. Featuring Santyago, the album brings light onto what Faux’s unique sound actually is. With a mix of calypso, R&B, steel drum music, reggae, reggaeton, hip hop, future bass, soul, R&B, disco, funk, and electro, “Kuro” is a journey throughout the world and a personal story shown in lyrics and sound.
