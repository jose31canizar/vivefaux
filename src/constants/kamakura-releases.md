## Origin
</br>
</br>
To finish Kamakura Record’s first season, we have released the compilation album “Origin” which brings together all of our major single releases, with an additional two exclusive tracks (“Salesfloor" and “Blue”), from the label. The album shows all of the Kamakura artists showcasing their talents and skills. With production from Faux and Callan Hyatt, each individual song brings a different story and contributes brilliant writing towards the album. “Origin” has music from the beginning of the label, and is truly the origin of Kamakura Records, and ViveFaux.
